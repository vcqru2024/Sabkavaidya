## Quick Intro To The Jobs App for DNN
A [DNN App][2sxc] is like a DNN module, just way better :). Since this is an open-code/open-source 2sxc-app, you can customize it to be anything you want! This list just shows what it already does, so you know what you get out-of-the-first-box.

Because it's so simple and uses 2sxc, you can easily
* [translate it into any other language in minutes][translate]

## Getting Started

This app is only useful is you use DNN. So assuming you have a DNN installation, all you need to do is install 2sxc and this app. 

* Now you can use this app as-is, or customize it to be whatever you need it to be. 

* It probably helps to review the [Overview][overview] about how the parts play together by default, so you can then change as little as necessary to get it to do what you want

## Customize the App

The Source Code is all here - so you can easily customize to your hearts desire!
