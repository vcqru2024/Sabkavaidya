## Getting Started

This app is only useful is you use DNN. So assuming you have a DNN installation, all you need to do is install 2sxc and this app. 

* Now you can use this app as-is, or customize it to be whatever you need it to be. 

* It probably helps to review the [Overview][overview] about how the parts play together by default, so you can then change as little as necessary to get it to do what you want
