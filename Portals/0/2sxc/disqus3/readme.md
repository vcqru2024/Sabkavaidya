## Customize the App

There is only one app setting and only a few app resources you can change.

If you want to customize the CSS, you will usually follow the ["Create Custom Styles in a Standard 2sxc App" checklist](https://azing.org/2sxc/r/gg_aB9FD).
But note that you usually don't want to do this, as added snippets should just be as-is
