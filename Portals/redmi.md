  # How deploy a DotNetNuke (DNN) project on an IIS server, follow these steps:

# 1. Set Up IIS on Your Server
    Ensure that IIS is installed on your server.
    Enable ASP.NET features under Application Development within IIS.
# 2. Prepare the DNN Application Files
    Publish your DNN site from your development environment or get a pre-built DNN installation.
    Copy the DNN files to a folder on your server, typically something like C:\inetpub\wwwroot\DNN.
# 3. Create a Database in SQL Server
    Open SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS).
    Create a new database (e.g., DNN_DB) for the DNN installation.
    Create a SQL Server user with sufficient permissions (db_owner) for this database.
# 4. Configure IIS
     Open IIS Manager.
     Right-click Sites > Add Website.
     Site name: Enter a name for your DNN site.
     Physical path: Browse to the DNN folder you copied.
    Host name: Enter a domain name or use localhost for local testing.
    Set Application Pool to No Managed Code for DNN versions before 9.0 or Integrated mode for later versions.
    Save and close.
# 5. Set Folder Permissions
    Give Network Service or IIS_IUSRS full permissions to the DNN folder to allow DNN to manage files.
# 6. Configure DNN for the New Database and Domain
    In the DNN folder, locate web.config.
    Update the connectionStrings section with your SQL Server connection details.
# 7. Access the Site and Complete the Installation
     Open a browser and navigate to the site (e.g., http://localhost or the domain you configured).
     Follow the DNN installation wizard to complete setup.
     Enter the database connection details.
     Configure the admin account.
# 8. Troubleshoot Common Issues
    Check that ASP.NET and IIS modules are enabled.
    Confirm database connection strings are correct.
    Verify folder permissions.
    Once configured, your DNN site should be accessible via IIS.

To configure IIS for deploying a DNN (DotNetNuke) project, follow these detailed steps:

1. Open IIS Manager
Press Win + R, type inetmgr, and press Enter to open IIS Manager.
Alternatively, go to Control Panel > Administrative Tools > Internet Information Services (IIS) Manager.
2. Add a New Website
In the Connections panel, right-click on Sites and select Add Website.
In the Add Website window, enter the following details:
Site Name: Enter a name for your site (e.g., DNN_Site).
Physical Path: Select the folder where you placed the DNN files (e.g., C:\inetpub\wwwroot\DNN).
Host Name: Enter the domain name or use localhost for local testing.
3. Configure the Application Pool
In the Add Website window:
Click on the Select... button next to the Application Pool.
Choose No Managed Code for DNN versions before 9.0 or Integrated mode for DNN versions 9.0 and above.
Click OK to create the application pool and close the dialog.
4. Bind the Site to a Port and IP Address
Under Bindings, set the Type to http.
Assign an IP address or use All Unassigned to allow access from any IP.
Set the Port to 80 (or a different port if using an alternate configuration).
Click OK to save the binding configuration.
5. Set Folder Permissions
Navigate to your DNN folder (e.g., C:\inetpub\wwwroot\DNN).
Right-click on the folder, select Properties, and go to the Security tab.
Click Edit... and add IIS_IUSRS and/or Network Service with Modify permissions.
This step is crucial, as DNN needs permission to manage files, cache, and install modules.
6. Configure Web.config for Database
In the DNN folder, open the web.config file.
Find the <connectionStrings> section and add your SQL Server connection details.
Save and close the file.
7. Test the Configuration
Open a browser and go to the URL for your DNN site (e.g., http://localhost or the specified hostname).
The DNN installation wizard should appear, where you can complete the setup.
Your DNN site should now be configured on IIS, and you can proceed with the installation wizard to finalize the deployment.
