## Customize the App

Gallery App V7 with Fancybox4 uses the new, [standard Settings-System in 2sxc](http://r.2sxc.org/settings) to configure it. It also has app resources (i18n labels) you can customize.

If you want to customize the CSS, you will usually follow the ["Create Custom Styles in a Standard 2sxc App" checklist](https://azing.org/2sxc/r/Lu5SDBqU)
